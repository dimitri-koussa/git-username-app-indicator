git-username-app-indicator
==========================

Shows the git user.name using AppIndicator and provides a context menu to pick the last few options.

This is useful in a pair-programming development environment where:
* the user.name is set to the name of the pair (e.g., 'John Smith and Bob Jones')
* you swap machines when you swap pairs
* the git user.name setting is cleared every day
This tool makes the current value visible on the panel and provides a convenience menu to assign a new value.

This tool was developed as a quality of life enhancement for software developers at Tyro Payments.
